# NormalityAnalysis
Normality Analysis + Python

Running multiple normality tests simultaneously.
What is the impact and importance of performing a normality test on our datasets?

The objective is to analyze whether our data follow a normal distribution to ensure the effectiveness of our findings, guarantee more robust comparisons between groups, and provide more reliable predictions. Failing to include this step can lead to overfitting of our models, resulting in incorrect conclusions and a limited ability to generate new scenarios.
In a retail company, this would positively impact sales estimation, product performance, customer behavior, and satisfaction, among other areas.
Strategies:
·      Analytical Methods & Graphical Representations (Histogram and Normal Curve Fit, Q-Q Plot, Boxplots)
·      Hypothesis Tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, D’Agostino-Pearson)
